# Capstone Project Design Document
(Global Navigation Satellite System)
### _Objective:_
To successfully improve mobile phone location/gps to as accurate and precise with the world’s coordinates down to a decimeter

### _Background:_
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides raw signals, which the GPS chipset uses to compute a position. Current mobile phones only offer 3-5 meters of positioning accuracy. While useful in many cases, it can create a “jumpy” experience. For many use cases the results are not fine nor stable enough to be reliable.

### _Design/Ideas:_
##### Part 1
1. Acquire the dataset and Download it
2. Analyze the the data
3. Put the dataset into a Data Frame
4. Define what model we want to use 
5. After train and test the model and observe the results

##### Part 2
1. Acquire the dataset again
2. Perform steps 3-6
3. Tune the model and validate it

### _Project Plan:_

- Acquire and prep dataset --- Jul 13, 2021
- Start defining and training model --- Jul 15, 2021
- Work on presentation --- Jul 16, 2021
- Use data to tune model and validate --- Jul 16, 2021	
- Get it checked and reviewed by staff --- Jul 20,2021
- Practice Presention --- Jul 23,2021

#### _Roles_ ####
**Nigel Campbell-Christie** - ***Note Taker:*** Writing down organized notes on what is happening within the project and will be typing out everyone’s information on what is working in the project and what is not working in the project.

**Dominik Allison** - ***Presentation Designer:*** Take lead on the design and format of the powerpoint presentation. They acquire the information from the research they have been working on and convert it into a powerpoint presentation.

**Cameron Moorehead** - ***Program Manager:***  oversee the entire project. They will be responsible for the success of all the interconnected projects within the program

**Josh Hamlett** - ***Leader Code Programmer:*** Focus on analyzing the dataset and organize the on what model to use for the concept of the project.
