4. Download the google smartphone decimeter challenge folder from kaggle
5. Unzip that folder
6. Go into the unzipped folder
7. Create a new folder called **"sample3"** in the unzipped google smartphone decimeter challenge folder, this will hold the samples you choose
8. Go into the train folder in the unzipped folder
